    "# Getting started with Cross-region Inference in Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference profiles via Amazon Bedrock allow you to perform cross-region inference without the need to setup anything in a fully-managed, secure and private manner. Inference profiles is a managed feature built on Amazon Bedrock, offering generative AI application builders a seamless solution for managing traffic bursts and ensuring optimal availability and performance. By leveraging this feature, builders no longer have to spend time and effort building complex resiliency structure. Instead, inference profiles intelligently routes traffic across multiple opted-in regions, automatically adapting to peak utilization surges. Any inferences carried out through inference profiles will dynamically utilize on-demand capacity available from any of the configured regions, maximizing availability and throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features & Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Access to capacity in different regions allowing generative AI workloads to scale with demand.\n",
    "* Access to region-agnostic models to achieve higher throughput.\n",
    "* Become resilient to any traffic bursts.\n",
    "* Ability to select between the pre-defined region sets suiting application needs.\n",
    "* Compatible with existing APIs.\n",
    "* No additional cost.\n",
    "* Same model pricing as the primary region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end-user experience is not impacted as the model behind cross-region inference remains the same, and builders can focus on writing logic for a differentiated application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bedrock is the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications. Cross region inference further enhances the usability."

In order to determine, which region the request should go to Amazon Bedrock intelligently checks in real-time which region has redundant capacity available. The on-demand principle still applies if none of the region has capacity to handle the request, then it will be throttled.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-region inference provides the ability to manage bursts and spiky traffic patterns across a variety of generative AI workloads and disparate request shapes.With this feature you can easily scale your workloads in production without the need of heavy-lifting, lengthy migrations and overhead of infrastructure management. Amazon Bedrock handles the routing securely, reliably and in a transparent manner while giving you the control you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key considerations\n",
    "While building or migrating applications to use of cross-region inference, it is important to keep in mind the following:\n",
    "- **Latency** - If your application is latency sensitive, it is advised to properly test the use of cross-region inference prior to fully relying on it since the routing to different regions could lead to higher latency numbers thus impacting your application behavior.\n",
    "- **Compliance** - Cross-region inference comes with pre-defined region sets, if these sets contain a region where you can't operate or goes against your policy, then it is advised not to use Inference Profiles, instead utilize Foundation Models directly.\n",
    "- **Determinism** - If you need to have control over where your requests are (or will be) re-routed (other than primary region), it is better to consider just rely on Foundation Model directly. Also the model exclusive to cross-region inference exclusive models should be opted for carefully.\n",
    "- **Variety** - Inference Profiles do not provide access to multiple different models from different regions, it either acts as a failover mechanism for models in primary region or provides Inference Profile exclusive models where the construct of a region is abstracted away. If your business demands to span across variety of foundation models from multiple regions, it is wise to consider building your own architecture via VPC Peering/Transit Gateway or other architectural patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ran the **Monitoring, Logging, and Metrics** code, consider disabling the Model Invocation Log to avoid incuring associated cost."
