# Function Calling

With function calling, we can provide LLMs with descriptions of tools and functions it can use. An LLM is able to intelligently decide based on user query when and how to use those tools to help answer questions and complete tasks. 

This repository contains examples and use-cases to get you started with Function Calling on Amazon Bedrock


## Contents


- **Amazon Bedrock Converse API function-calling (tool use) examples** - The Converse or ConverseStream API is a unified structured text API action that allows you simplifying the invocations to Bedrock LLMs, using a universal syntax and message structured prompts for any of the supported model providers, and adding support for tool use of function calling with a unified syntax. For more information check the documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html) and the API reference [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html).
